Day 10 & 11 - Support Vector Machine.

SVM 
  Support vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both the classification and regression.
 But it is mostly used in the classification problems. In the algorithm, we will point the data in the n-dimensional space with the value
 of each feature being the value of the particular coordinate.
 
 The data is been classified by the hyperplane and the the hyperplan which seperates the data and its classes very well. This algorithm output 
 the optimal hyperplane which categorizes the new hyper plane.
 
 
 The tuning paramaters that are involved in the SVM are
 Kernel - The learning of the hyper plane in SVM is done by transforming the problem using some linear algebra. Polynomial and exponential 
 kernel calculates seperation line in higher dimension
 
 Regularisation - The optimisation will choose a smaller margin hyper plane if the hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points
 classified correctly.
 
 Margin -  A margin is a seperation of line to the closest class points. A good margin is one where this seperation is larger for both the classes.
