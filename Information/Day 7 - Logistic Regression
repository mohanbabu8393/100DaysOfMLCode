Day 7 - Logistic regression

Logistic regression is used for classification problems, used to predict group to which the current object under which observation it belongs to.

Methodology:

Logistic regression measures the relationship between the dependent variable and the one or more independent variables by estimating probablities 
using its logistic function.

The S shaped curve that can take any real valued number and map it to a value between the range of 0 and 1.

The probablities are transformed into binary values in order to actually make a prediction.
This is also called as the sigmoid function.

Logistic regression always gives you a discrete result and linear regression always gives you a continuous result.
