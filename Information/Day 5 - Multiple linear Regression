Day 5 - Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear regression models the features between two or more features and  response by fitting a linear equation of the observed data.

The steps to perform the multiple linear regression is same as that of the simple linear regression. The difference lies only in the evaluation.
We can use it find out which variable has the highest impact on the predicted out and the relationship between the other variables.

y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+b4x4+....bnxn  ,  where y is the dependent variable and b0+b1x1... are the independent variables.

Steps to implement the Multiple linear regression.

1. Preprocess the dataset.
        a. Import the libraries
        b. Import he dataset
        c. check for the missing data
        d. Encode the categorical data
        e. Featre scaling.
        
 2. Fitting the model to the training set.
        a. This step is exactly the same as for the simple linear regression 
        b. So, we use LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model library
        c. Then from the linearegression class, we make the object regressor.
        d. using the fit() method, we fit the method of the linearRegression class.
        
3. Predicting the test results.
        a. Now we will predict the results from the observations of the test set.
        b. we will use the Y_pred. To predict the result we use predict() method of the linear regression class.
        
        
Done :)
